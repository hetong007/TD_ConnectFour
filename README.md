TD_ConnectFour
==============

This is a practice for **Temporal Difference Learning Algorithm**, mostly inspired by [Temporal Difference Learning and TD-Gammon](http://www.bkgm.com/articles/tesauro/tdl.html) By Gerald Tesauro.

Implementation method comes from this [document](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/tdgammon/pa4.pdf).

My program requires 1 hour for 10000 games. It could be faster in the future.
